# About

I am a software developer who is curious about many programming languages and technologies. I love to try new things, and I've programmed in 20+ languages for vastly different applications, from websites to mining equipment. It's fun, but it makes it difficult for me to remember what I've learned. This repo is an attempt to retain the knowledge.
